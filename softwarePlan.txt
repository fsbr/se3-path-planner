I'll try to outline exactly the things that I need this project to do.

I'd also like to include here the ways that we are going to CHECK and verify
that those things make sense.

1.  Models the Cusp based on TS96. 
1c.1.  The check is if we can generate those same plots from the N.Tsyg paper,
    and if the colormap is similar to the one that brian does.
1c.2.  If I'm able to plot cones for the cusp that make sense and then plot
        the orbits that would be nice too.
1c.3. does the daily/dinural change. 

2.  Models the Sun as a static circular obstacles
2c.  If I plot a circle in the disrcete equirectangular space then I did it.

3.  outputs a vector of so3 coordinates, and converts them to euler angle
    commandables for the robot

4.  models the desired attitudes via the se3 thing I wrote already

5.  models the simulated attitudes via some control mechanism.


TODO:  go into some details for each part.  Write a new document from the POV
    of the programmer.  Include thigns like function calls, specific IDEAS about
    the algorithm.  I'm thinking specifically about how we calculate the cusp
    crossings.
