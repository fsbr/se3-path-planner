what i'm doing is trying to generate the
fucking colormap.  let's GO

one thing really annoying is that i actually didnt do a linear timestep
i did a variable timestep. testing random datapoints led to

60s step
90s step etc.
99.81 seconds etc.

fix
1. add interpolation so that the most time between is 1 second,

this means like a 100 point interpolation (for now lets assume linear is fine)

2. collision detect my counter
