    "I used the Tsyganenko model of the cusp position.  This model describes the cusp position in the noon-midnight meridian using a cylindrical coordinate system.  The $r$ and $\\theta$ components are occuring in the xz plane.  The neutral axis is therefore the $y$ axis.  \n",

    "\\phi_{c} = arcsin(\\frac{\\sqrt{\\rho}}{\\sqrt{\\rho + \\sin^{-2}(\\phi_{1}) -1}}) + \\psi\n",

    "Here, $\\rho$ is the radial of the satellite from the center of the earth.  $\\phi_{c}$ is the colatitude of the cusp position.  $\\psi$ is the dipole tilt of the cusp.  $\\phi_{1}$ is provided by the equation $\\phi_{c0} - (\\alpha_{1} \\psi + \\alpha_{2}\\psi^{2})$.  As in (Tsyganenko) the values of $\\phi_{c}$, $\\alpha_{1}$, and $\\alpha_{2}$ are 0.24, 0.1287, and 0.0314 respectively.
